# Iterative Spectral Method ( ISM ) 

Iterative Spectral Method (ISM) was originally proposed in the paper 
*Iterative Spectral Method for Alternative Clustering*, Wu et al., AISTATS 2018. 
It is an optimization technique that could be used to solve many HSIC related problems with a 
Gaussian Kernel. This version is written as an easy extension to other kernels. 


## Getting Started

The code is written with python3 on a Mint Linux Machine version 17.1. 
The following libraries must be included.

  1. numpy
  2. matplotlib
  3. sklearn
  4. scipy


## How to Run
 Just run ./sdr.py to see it in action.
